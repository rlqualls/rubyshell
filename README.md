# rubyshell -- manage your unix systems with pure Ruby

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rlqualls/rubyshell.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rlqualls/rubyshell)

Rubyshell is a UNIX shell written in Ruby based on rush by Adam Wiggins et al.

## Objectives:

  1. Modernize the codebase
  2. Increase the blur between UNIX and Ruby. Fallback to local commands.
  3. Add support for plugins/customization

## Testing it Out

    $ git clone https://github.com/rlqualls/rubyshell
    $ cd rubyshell
    $ bin/rubyshell

## Status:

Hopefully there will be an initial release by March 2014.
