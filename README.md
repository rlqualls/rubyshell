# rubyshell -- manage your unix systems with pure Ruby

Rubyshell is a UNIX shell written in Ruby based on rush by Adam Wiggins et al.

## Objectives:

  1. Modernize rush
  2. Increase the blur between UNIX and Ruby. Right now we can't type "ls" into rush.
  3. Add support for plugins/customization
